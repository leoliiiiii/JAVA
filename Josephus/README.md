Josephus Problem

There are people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. A certain number of people are skipped
and then one person is executed. This is repeated starting with the person after the person who was
executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller as the executed
people are removed) until one person remains.
The goal is to determine where to stand in the circle so that you are the last person alive.
